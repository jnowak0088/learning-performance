# learning-performance
The regression project, which tries to answer the question: 'what are the key factors of learning performance'

The project consists of 3 files:

Student_Performance.csv - the database
library.jpg - the photo (illustration)
code.ipynb - the Jupyter Notebook

Due to the size of the Jupyter Notebook, it may not render properly on GitHub. If so, I recommend to use https://nbviewer.org/ to open the project.

If you have any thoughts about the project - please, inform me.
Thank you!
